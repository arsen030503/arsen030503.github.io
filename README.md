Todo List App with User Registration

This code represents a simple Todo List application with user registration functionality. Let's break down the components:

registration.html
This file defines the structure of the registration page.
It includes a registration form and a login form.
The forms have input fields for username and password.
registration.js
Manages user registration and login.
Uses local storage to store user information.
Sends data to a mock API for registration.
main.html
Represents the main Todo List application.
Allows the user to create new todos, categorize them, and displays the list.
Includes a greeting section where the user can input their name.
main.js
Manages the main functionality of the Todo List application.
Uses local storage to store todos and the user's name.
Provides the ability to add, edit, delete todos, and mark them as done.
CSS Files
registration.css: Styles for the registration page.
main.css: Styles for the Todo List application.
Key Points:
User Registration:

The user registers by providing a username and password on the registration page.
Registration data is sent to a mock API using the sendDataToMockAPI function.
Login:

Users can log in on the registration page using the login form.
Login data is also sent to the mock API.
Todo List:

Todos are created using the "CREATE A TODO" section in main.html.
Todos are categorized as "business" or "personal."
The user's name is stored in local storage and displayed in the greeting section.
LocalStorage:

User data, todos, and the user's name are stored in the local storage.
Logout:

The logout button clears user-related data from local storage and redirects to the registration page.
Usage:
Open registration.html to access the registration and login forms.
After registration or login, the user is redirected to main.html.
In the Todo List app, the user can create, edit, and delete todos.
The logout button allows the user to log out and return to the registration page.
Recommendations:
This code uses local storage, which is not secure for storing sensitive information in a real-world application.
In a production environment, consider implementing a secure authentication system with server-side validation.
